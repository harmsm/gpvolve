def flatten_neighbors(gpm):
    """
    Flatten the neighbors in a GenotypePhenotypeMap into a 1D array. This is
    a useful form for neighbors in fast cython/c simluation methods. All rows in
    gpm.neighbors with gpm.neighbors.include == True are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gpm : GenotypePhenotypeMap
        A GenotypePhenotypeMap with neighbors calculated.

    Returns
    -------
    neigbor_slicer : np.ndarray
        2D array of ints that is num_genotypes by 2. Indicates where to look for
        each genotype's neighbors in the 1D neighbors array. If
        neighbor_slicer[4,0] -> 6 and neighbor_slicer[4,1] -> 12, the neighbors
        for gentoype 4 are held in neighbors[6:12]. neighbor_slicer is
        guaranteed to have an entry for every genotype, even those without any
        neighbors. If a genotype "i" has no neighbors, neighbor_slicer[i,[0,1]]
        == [-1,-1].
    neighbors : np.ndarray
        1D array of ints holding neighbors for each genotype flattened into a
        single vector of the form |genotype_0_neighbors|genotype_1_neighbors|...
