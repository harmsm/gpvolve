def to_greedy(transition_matrix):
    """
    Turn transition matrix into 'greedy' transition matrix. Only the step with
    the highest positive fitness difference is allowed (prob. = 1), all other
    steps are not permitted (prob. = 0).
    Parameters
    ----------
    transition_matrix : 2D numpy.ndarray.
        Transition matrix where the highest value T(i->j) per row i should
        correspond to the step s(i->j) where j is the neighbor of genotype i
        with the highest fitness. Can be obtained using the 'ratio' fixation
        function, where transition probability T(i->j) is simply the ratio of
        fitness j over fitness i.
    Returns
    -------
    M : 2D numpy.ndarray.
        Transition matrix corresponding to a 'greedy random walk' on the
        genotype-phenotype map.
