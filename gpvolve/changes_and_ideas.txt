# Changes as of 10/12/21

1. gpmsm (GenotypePhenotypeMSM), which was a subclass of gpgraph, was scrapped.
2. Package is being refactored as a collection of tools that can be used
    directly on a gpmap object (since gpmap + gpgraph are now one).
3. Usages of NetworkX are being phased out (main use was making transition matrix,
    which the program now does using cython).
    Note: unless necessary, 'markov' and 'simulate' submodules won't require much meddling
    since they are working fine.
4. 'Utils' was combined in a single folder
5. '__init__.py' files inside each submodule were fixed
6. "GenotypePhenotypeClusters" class was deleted because it was a subclass of gpmsm.
7. Redundant functions deleted and
