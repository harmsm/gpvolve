# Initial changes

1. gpmsm (GenotypePhenotypeMSM), which was a subclass of gpgraph, was scrapped.
2. Package is being refactored as a collection of tools that can be used
    directly on a gpmap object (since gpmap + gpgraph are now one).
3. Usages of NetworkX are being phased out (main use was making transition matrix,
    which the program now does using cython).
    Note: unless necessary, 'markov' and 'simulate' submodules won't require much meddling
    since they are working fine.
4. 'Utils' was combined in a single folder
5. '__init__.py' files inside each submodule were fixed

# Troubleshooting
1. Figure out where to put decorator properties of old GenotypePhenotypeMSM subclass.
    Some of the functions are already utils.
2. Scrap obsolete code from all submodules.
3. Making sure essential functions are still working after eliminating gpmsm subclass.

# Goals for 10/12/21
1. Clear up and organize existing code into a useful collection of functions for gpmap.
2. Make current 'gpvole' compatible with current version of 'gpmap'
3. Write at least a unit test for each written piece of code, and at least one for each
    faulty existing piece of code and/or code that needs to be refactored.
4. Get binder, jupyter examples and 'pip' installation back online.

Update: do not prepare a pip installation
